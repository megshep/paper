#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al., 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region, 
but continental scale measurements have not previously been made. 

A large uncertainity in modelling BBOA is the extent to which
measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional
scale.
